# Organizations

Organizations allow teams to manage secrets centrally with shared billing and member management.

## How Organizations Work

When you install the [Keyway GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/keyway-sh) on a GitHub organization, Keyway automatically:

1. Creates an organization in Keyway
2. Syncs members from GitHub
3. Links organization repos to the org billing

**Key concept:** Organization membership mirrors GitHub. If someone is added to/removed from your GitHub org, Keyway syncs automatically.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Install the GitHub App

Install the Keyway GitHub App on your organization:

1. Go to [github.com/apps/keyway-sh](https://github.com/apps/keyway-sh)
2. Click **Install**
3. Select your organization
4. Choose which repositories to enable

### 2. Start a Trial

Organization owners can start a 14-day Team plan trial:

1. Go to your organization in the [dashboard](https://keyway.sh/dashboard)
2. Click **Start Trial**

Or via API:

```http
POST /v1/orgs/:org/trial/start
```

## Members

### Viewing Members

View organization members in the [dashboard](https://keyway.sh/dashboard) or via API:

```http
GET /v1/orgs/:org/members
```

### Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access: billing, settings, member sync |
| **Member** | Access based on GitHub repo permissions |

:::tip GitHub = Source of Truth
Keyway doesn't have separate member management. Add/remove people from your GitHub organization, and Keyway updates automatically.
:::

### Syncing Members

Members sync automatically when:
- Someone accesses a vault
- App webhooks fire
- Manual sync is triggered

Force a manual sync:

```http
POST /v1/orgs/:org/members/sync

## FAQ

### How is organization access determined?

Keyway checks your GitHub organization membership. If you're a member of the GitHub org, you can access organization vaults (subject to repo permissions).

### Can I have multiple organizations?

Yes. You can be a member of multiple GitHub organizations, each with their own Keyway organization.

### What happens when I remove someone from GitHub?

Their Keyway access is revoked immediately. The next sync (automatic or manual) removes them from the organization.

### Do all org members need Keyway accounts?

Members only need a Keyway account when they first access a vault. The account is created automatically via GitHub OAuth.
